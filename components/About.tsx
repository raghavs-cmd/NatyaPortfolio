                          1. Create a folder named 'assets' in the root directory of your project (the same level as 'index.html').
                          2. Place your profile picture inside this 'assets' folder (e.g., 'natya.jpeg').
                          3. The `src` attribute below is set to "/assets/natya.jpeg". The leading slash means the browser will look for the 'assets' folder from the root of the site.
                          4. If your image has a different name, just update the path below.
